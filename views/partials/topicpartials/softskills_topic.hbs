    <h3>Suddenly You're a People Person</h3>
    <p>You chose a technical career for a reason — it made sense, it felt comfortable, and it probably didn’t involve much small talk. But somewhere along the way, the job changed. Now you're expected to lead meetings, build client relationships, mentor junior staff, and deliver polished presentations… all while hitting your chargeability targets.<br><br>
It’s not that you’re bad at these things — it’s that no one trained you for them. You weren’t handed a script for managing difficult conversations or a playbook for building trust in five minutes over coffee. And yet, these moments are becoming the most visible and impactful parts of your job.<br><br>
The pressure to “just figure it out” is real. But so is the possibility of getting better at it — with guidance that understands your world.

    <h3>Soft Skills are Learned Differently</h3>
    <p>Can you learn to play the piano by reading a book about playing piano? We all know the answer to that. Some skills require you to build muscle memory over time by doing. Anything that involves managing working relationships, negotiation, or communication fall under this definition. These are considered “soft” skills and aren’t learned in a traditional classroom. Colleges and universities are aware of this challenge. They incorporate soft skills material into instruction and exercises, but formal learning institutions are also under pressure to deliver as much technical learning as possible within a short window, so soft skills inevitably play second fiddle.

    <h3>Teamwork is a Skill</h3>
    <p>Ask most managers and they’ll agree—teamwork is essential to success. But many workplace systems send the opposite message. Cubicles, individual KPIs, and recognition programs often reward solo performance more than shared effort. Collaboration may be valued in theory, but it's rarely supported in practice.<br><br>
The good news? Teamwork can be learned and strengthened—just like any other skill. Even short, focused exercises can shift how people communicate, solve problems, and support one another.<br><br>
Twennie helps technical teams build better habits of working together—without pulling them away from the work that matters.

    <h3>Connection Without Compromise</h3>
    <p>Introverts can absolutely thrive in business development and leadership — but most advice isn’t built with them in mind. For many introverted professionals, client calls and networking events aren’t energizing; they’re draining. It’s not about lacking skill or ambition. It’s about needing space to recharge and work in ways that feel sustainable.
Thriving in a people-focused role doesn’t mean becoming someone you’re not. It means learning to manage your energy, communicate with intention, and build meaningful relationships without stretching yourself thin.<br><br>Twennie offers strategies that support introverted professionals—so you can lead, connect, and contribute in ways that feel authentic and effective.

    <h3>Practice, Not Theory, Builds Soft Skills</h3>
    <p>Can you learn to play the piano by reading a book about playing piano? Of course not. Some skills only develop through repetition, feedback, and real-world application. The same is true for communication, negotiation, and team dynamics — the so-called “soft” skills that actually shape how well we lead, collaborate, and earn trust.<br><br>
These skills aren’t absorbed through theory alone. They’re built over time by doing — especially in complex, high-pressure work environments.<br><br>
Colleges and universities know this. Many weave soft skills into projects and group work. But formal education still prioritizes technical learning, often under tight timelines. As a result, soft skills take a back seat — even though they’re the ones that often determine your impact.

    <h3>The Difference Between People and Technology</h3>
    <p>In technical work, failure isn’t taken lightly—and for good reason. Standards, peer reviews, and rigorous testing exist to prevent costly mistakes. But human relationships don’t follow that same rulebook. There are no rehearsals or simulations—just real conversations, with real consequences.<br><br>
For many technical professionals, that unpredictability can feel uncomfortable. Missteps may be overanalyzed or taken as signs of deeper shortcomings. But in the context of communication, leadership, and trust-building, mistakes are part of how we learn.<br><br>
Twennie helps reframe this thinking, offering tools and exercises that bring clarity, build confidence, and make navigating relationships feel less risky—and far more rewarding.
