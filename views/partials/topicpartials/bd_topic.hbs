    <h3>The Challenge of Staying Switched On</h3>
    <p>When a B2B client brings you on, you're not just delivering a service—you’re stepping into their team. That kind of integration sets technical professionals apart from most other providers. The way you show up day-to-day shapes not only the outcome of the project, but your long-term relationship and reputation within their network.<br><br>
More than any website or pitch deck, it’s your presence—steady, professional, responsive—that defines how clients experience your firm.<br><br>
Twennie helps you stay “switched on” in the moments that matter most—because that’s where trust is built, and business development truly begins.

    <h3>The Project Lifecycle - According to the Client</h3>
    <p>Staying “switched on” means staying engaged with your clients—even when there’s no active project on the table. In fact, that in-between time can be the most important.
For clients, projects are always in motion—shaped by budgets, internal conversations, shifting priorities, and long-term goals. Strong business development isn’t about waiting for RFPs. It’s about staying visible, listening closely, and building trust long before the formal process begins.<br><br>
When your team understands the project lifecycle from the client’s perspective, you’re not just well-positioned to respond. You’re already part of the conversation.

    <h3>Clearing the Underbrush of Distractions</h3>
    <p>Business development in technical services often drifts outside the comfort zone. Negotiation, candid conversations, and difficult feedback don’t come naturally to every technical professional—and over time, the industry has responded with layers of structure: forms, flowcharts, models, platforms.<br><br>
These tools are meant to create clarity, but too often they create distance.<br><br>
The real challenge today isn’t adding more systems—it’s cutting through the noise and reconnecting with what matters: honest, human conversations about the work.<br><br>
Twennie offers tools and strategies to support that connection—but more importantly, we help teams refocus on the relationships that drive trust, loyalty, and growth. That’s where business really begins.

    <h3>The Milestone of Saying No</h3>
    <p>A true sign of growth in business development is knowing when to say no to a project. It means your team has earned trust, built a strong portfolio, and no longer needs to chase every opportunity to prove its value.<br><br>
But this isn’t just a process shift—it’s a cultural one. Selectivity becomes part of your brand, and that mindset needs to take hold across the team—from senior leaders to junior staff.<br><br>
A thoughtful go/no-go process emerges naturally when the culture is ready. The tools, forms, and spreadsheets don’t lead the shift—they follow it. Because saying no isn’t a risk. It’s a strategy.

    <h3>Defining Value, Not for You, But for the Client</h3>
    <p>The first step in developing new business is asking a deceptively simple question: What do clients truly value?<br><br>
It’s tempting to think that delivering what’s in the RFP is enough. But for most clients, that’s just the starting line. Meeting the requirements earns you a place at the table. Standing out requires something more: proactive thinking, thoughtful service, and value that goes beyond the checklist.<br><br>
When you define success through your client’s lens—not your own—you do more than meet expectations. You build trust, earn loyalty, and set your team apart.

    <h3>The Bespoke Solution</h3>
    <p>Understanding how different clients define value is one of the most challenging—and rewarding—skills in business development. It takes time to develop, and even more time to apply consistently under pressure.<br><br>
No two clients are alike, and no two proposals should be either. If clients could get what they needed off the shelf, they wouldn’t issue RFPs—they’d just go shopping. The fact that they’ve spent months, sometimes years, preparing a project means they’re looking for more than compliance. They’re looking for insight, relevance, and a response that feels like it was written for them.<br><br>
Twennie helps teams move beyond generic submissions by offering strategies and inspiration to craft proposals that resonate—and win.
