    <h3>Win Themes</h3>
    <p>At the heart of every strong proposal is a compelling win theme—an idea that ties everything together and reinforces why your team is the right choice.<br><br>
A win theme isn’t just a catchy message. It’s a clearly expressed value proposition, supported consistently across the proposal—through writing, visuals, and tone. It reflects your understanding of the client, the project, and the outcomes that matter most.<br><br>
Done well, a win theme doesn’t just repeat your message. It makes it stick—by making it matter.

    <h3>Show That You're Paying Attention</h3>
    <p>Clients want to know you’ve truly listened, that you understand their project, their priorities, and what success means to them. That means going beyond general qualifications. It means tailoring your message, aligning it with their goals, and responding with specifics that demonstrate thoughtful attention. Twennie supports proposal writers in creating documents that feel personal, relevant, and clearly focused on the client’s needs.</p>

    <h3>Define Success on Their Terms</h3>
    <p>Before highlighting your strengths, take the time to define success the way the client sees it. When your proposal reflects their language, goals, and vision, your firm becomes easier to imagine as a trusted partner.<br><br>
The closer your understanding aligns with theirs, the stronger your case. And when it doesn’t? Knowing when to step back can be just as strategic as leaning in.<br><br>
Twennie helps teams build this kind of judgment into their proposal strategy—so every pursuit is guided by fit, clarity, and purpose.

    <h3>The RFP Is Not the Whole Story</h3>
    <p>The RFP gives you a roadmap—but not the full picture. It outlines the formal requirements, but many of the real decision factors never make it to the page.<br><br>
Evaluators bring their own priorities, preferences, and expectations to the table. That means the strongest proposals go beyond compliance. They build trust, speak to both logic and emotion, and reflect a clear understanding of what truly matters.<br><br>
Twennie helps proposal teams read between the lines—and respond with clarity, relevance, and insight.

    <h3>Evidence of Experience, Interest, and Care</h3>
    <p>Clients want more than promises—they want proof. That’s why clearly presented, relevant experience matters. It shows that your team has done this kind of work before—and can do it again.<br><br>
The more specific your examples, the better. Use data to quantify the effort, the challenges, and the results. Pair that with clear, confident writing that helps the client build their internal case.<br><br>
It’s not just about past performance. It’s about showing that you’re prepared, capable, and genuinely invested in their success.

    <h3>Understand the Competition</h3>
    <p>Smart proposals don’t just highlight your strengths. They position them strategically. That means understanding who else the client might consider, and why.
What do your competitors do well? Where might they fall short? Listening to client feedback, reviewing debriefs, and studying past pursuits helps you anticipate the field and differentiate with purpose.<br><br>
Twennie supports a reflective, research-driven approach to competitor awareness—so your proposals are focused, informed, and a step ahead.
