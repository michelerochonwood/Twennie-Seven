    <h3>Measuring Success Differently</h3>

Unlike traditional businesses that measure success primarily through profit margins, social enterprises evaluate their performance through a double or triple bottom line approach, considering social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. These organizations tackle challenges ranging from poverty and unemployment to environmental sustainability and healthcare access, using innovative business models to create lasting positive change.</p>
