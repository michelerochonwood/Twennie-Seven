    <h3>Shaping the Client's Experience</h3>
    <p>There are countless ways to define a “great experience”—and just as many expectations around what that looks like. That’s why experience programs can sometimes fall flat: misaligned perspectives make them hard to measure and even harder to manage. Take something as common as the annual client appreciation event. It’s a major effort and a valuable touchpoint, but who owns it? Is it the responsibility of a Client Experience (CX) team? Do you even have one? And if so, how does it align with the rest of the client’s journey? The real question is: does your organization offer a consistent, cohesive experience, or does it feel fragmented and improvised? Twennie helps technical teams think through these questions and build experience strategies that actually make sense on the ground.</p>

And when companies can compartmentalize critical elements, it makes X both accessible and actionable. </p>
