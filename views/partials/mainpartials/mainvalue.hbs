        <h3>making 20 minutes mean more</h3>
        <p>Twennie is named after the Pareto Principle, which states that 20 percent of our effort produces 80 percent of our results. Our mission is to make the 20 percent produce more. Our learners might have 20 minutes or less to learn something that makes a real difference in their work, and Twennie is committed to making that 20 minutes count.</p>

        <h3>no courses, quizzes, or tests</h3>
        <p>Our library discusses topics that don't have right or wrong answers - only ideas, angles, and advantages. Instead of testing your knowledge through courses, quizzes, and tests, we establish knowledge through action in small bursts over time.</p>

        <h3>units that compress and accelerate learning</h3>
        <p>Twennie provides content in units that compress and accelerate learning. Before you've spent any time at all, each unit tells you how much time you'll need to review it, ranging from five to 30 minutes. Twennie empowers you to learn more in the time you have.</p>

        <h3>the option to customize</h3>
        <p>Twennie gives you the chance to write your own learning content, but also to combine learning content you find in the Twennie library into new units. For instance, if you find three units and each one contains only select content you want to share with your team, you can take the needed content and combine it in one new unit. No need for them to sift through what's not needed.</p>
