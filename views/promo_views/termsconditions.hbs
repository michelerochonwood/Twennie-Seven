      <h2>Twennie Leader and Group Member Policy</h2>
      <h3>Mutual Respect and Professional Conduct</h3>
      <p>Twennie is a collaborative learning community where members share knowledge, insights, and professional experiences. As a leader or group member, you agree to uphold the following standards:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Respect for Others:</strong> Treat fellow members with kindness, respect, and professionalism. Engage in discussions and feedback with a spirit of constructive dialogue.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Tolerance for Harassment or Abuse:</strong> Twennie does not tolerate harassment, bullying, discrimination, or any form of abusive behavior. This includes but is not limited to offensive language, intimidation, or exclusionary practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Generous Collaboration:</strong> Members are encouraged to engage in collaborative learning exercises in a spirit of generosity, contributing knowledge and support to peers.</li>
        <li><strong>Constructive Feedback:</strong> When providing critiques or comments on learning units, ensure feedback is constructive, relevant, and aligned with the goal of fostering professional growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> If conflicts arise, members are expected to resolve them through respectful communication. Any concerns regarding violations of Twennie’s principles should be reported to the administrators.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Twennie’s Statement on Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>As a member of the Twennie learning community, you can submit your work to the library. This work might be an article, video, or interview you conducted with someone in your industry. It could be a prompt set you wrote, an exercise you created, or a template you designed. It might also be a combination of these units in the form of a micro course. You might conduct an internal micro study and share it on Twennie with other members. On the Twennie site, we refer to these as “learning units.” <br><br>
      If you have opted to create private, team-only content, your learning units will only be accessible to your group(s). If you have decided to share your learning content with all Twennie members, no learning unit you submit to the library will be used for any purpose other than to support learning and development for other Twennie members unless you consent to promotional use of your content at the time of upload or at a later date.</p>
      <p>As with all content submitted by Twennie members, your work is yours. Unless you wish to submit anonymously, every time your work appears on the Twennie platform or in Twennie emails or promotions, your name will appear with it. You have the option to refuse to allow your work to be used for promotional purposes, which you must indicate at the time of upload. Submitting to the library in all-member mode implies consent for Twennie administrators and members to access your work for learning purposes.</p>

      <h2>Twennie Approval</h2>
      <p>All content uploaded to the Twennie platform is subject to approval by Twennie administrators before becoming available to members. Approval might depend on the quality and teaching potential of the information, its length or word count, or its subject matter. If your content is rejected, you may contact Twennie directly for guidance on improving the material before resubmitting.</p>
      
      <h2>Twennie Not Liable</h2>
      <p>Be advised that the all-member Twennie library is open to anyone who completes a membership form with a valid email address. At no time will Twennie be held responsible for plagiarism or copyright violations of the work of members once posted on Twennie’s website. If you are concerned about infringement on your intellectual property, we recommend that you do not post it to Twennie in all-member mode. Private, team-only mode provides greater protection than all-member mode, but we still do not guarantee that your content will be invulnerable to infringement. Highly competitive or sensitive personal information should not be shared on the Twennie platform.</p>
      
      <h2>Prosecuting Copyright Infringements</h2>
      <p>Any legal prosecution of copyright infringement of the work of Twennie members published on the Twennie website is the sole responsibility of the author and not the responsibility of Twennie or its administrators, owners, or employees.</p>
      
      <h2>Cancellation</h2>
      <p>Upon cancelling your membership, you have the option to delete your submitted content. We humbly ask, however, that you allow Twennie to continue featuring your work in our all-member library. Your work forms part of an important body of knowledge, and we want to continue offering that knowledge to members. These terms and conditions confirm that Twennie will never attempt to prevent you from using your own work on other forums or publishing elsewhere in the future, but we would like to continue featuring it in the library even if you decide not to continue your Twennie membership. </p>
      
      <h2>Citations</h2>
      <p>If you wish to cite the work of a Twennie member in any forum other than on the Twennie website, it is your responsibility to obtain permission from the author and instructions on how that author wishes to be cited. Provide the author with a statement of the purpose for which the material will be used and how many times it will be featured.</p>
      
      <h2>Twennie Membership Activity Reporting</h2>
      <p>Submitting content to the all-member or private team libraries implies consent for the material to be incorporated into internal Twennie reports. This might include records of completed prompts, results of peer coaching over time, or membership longevity. This information could be used in Twennie's promotional materials, but your organization or members will not be named specifically without Twennie first obtaining yours or their written permission.</p>
      
      <h2>Competitive and Personal Information</h2>
      <p>Twennie will not accept library units that include the names or contact information of other people unless the unit comes equipped with written permission from those individuals and/or organizations. Links to the web content of member organizations or members are permitted on Twennie, but excessive promotional content is not. Twennie's platform is designed primarily for learning purposes. Promotional content will be approved or rejected according to the discretion of Twennie administrators.</p>
      
      <h2>Alternatives to Sharing Competitive Information</h2>
      <p>If you want to take advantage of a Twennie contributor membership but would prefer to avoid divulging competitive information, Twennie offers numerous alternatives. You can also use both all-member and private mode for submitting content, depending on the nature of that content. This must be specified at the time of upload.</p>
