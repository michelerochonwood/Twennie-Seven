            Twennie’s library is stacked with content authored by professionals in your industries. Members are also encouraged to contribute their own content: articles, videos, interviews, prompt sets, exercises, and templates. This collaborative learning model provides six core benefits:
          </p>
        </div>   
      <div class="what-is-twennie-promo-grid">
        <div class="grid-item animate">
          <h3>practical and applicable</h3>
          <p>The content on Twennie is not prepared by corporate trainers, but by professionals with experience in the relevant industries. Twennie gives you practical knowledge that’s directly applicable to your work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item animate">
          <h3>learn by teaching</h3>
          <p>Nothing reinforces learning more than developing content yourself. And that doesn’t have to mean a full, traditional course. Twennie does learning in smaller bits, so everyone can be a part of the process. It is accessible and collaborative, so engaging learners and content writers is effortless.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item animate">
          <h3>compare perspectives</h3>
          <p>A diverse member base ensures that we have access to ideas from multiple angles, because no one method or approach is right for every team or operation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item animate">
          <h3>supplement a portfolio</h3>
          <p>Depending on the present phase of your career, the member profile function in Twennie allows you to share your work with prospective clients and employers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item animate">
          <h3>make it your own</h3>
          <p>Either on your own or with the support of Twennie’s content development team, learning can be customized on Twennie for specific learning and development programs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item animate">
          <h3>flexible options</h3>
          <p>You can use Twennie for onboarding, to measure engagement, to roll out a new strategic plan, or encourage healthy daily work habits. In the same way, if you want access to Twennie’s content but would prefer not to contribute, it’s your choice.</p>

        <p>The learning units in Twennie are not courses. To consume less time, they are limited to what can be absorbed within 20 minutes. With articles, videos, and interviews, you can learn something new  at the start of the day or for a break from the grind, even on the commute. With prompt sets, exercises, and templates, you set the schedule for how you use them; daily, weekly, monthly or whatever frequency feels right for you. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item animate">
        <h3 class="grid=item-title3" style="color:#4a4ab2">reporting</h3>
        <p>Every time one of your team members engages with Twennie, a record appears in your report center. This enables you as a team leader to monitor the team's learning. Prompt sets allow you to guide them through tailored learning content, knowing that they can immediately put the learning into action.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item animate">
        <h3 class="grid=item-title3" style="color:#4a4ab2">growth and change</h3>
        <p>More so than traditional courses, Twennie is a tool for team growth. You can use Twennie to reinforce values, strategy, and creative ideas. Twennie can measure engagement and returns on investment in your people. You will see the results over time, not only in the Twennie dashboard, but in your team.</p>
